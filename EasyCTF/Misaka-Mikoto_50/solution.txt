The ciphertext was encoded via a railfence cipher in which the plaintext was split into 5 rails, or
rows. Using an online tool (http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/railfence.php), we can easily decode the encrypted message:

r       a       s       f       s
 a     s r     e t     t l     e p
  i   n   e   b   e   c   3   5   3
   l u     t e     a y     v l     r
    g       h       s       3       s
