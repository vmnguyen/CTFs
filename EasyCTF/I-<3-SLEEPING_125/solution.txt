Taking the numbers two at a time from the encrypted text, we get the following:

    38 45 28 19 45 28 38 05 28 45 26 05 35 25 26 05 47 38 05 16 45 37 48 16 47 48 47 83 17 45 45 08

Noticing how each pair of numbers begins with 0-4 and ends with 5-9, we can construct the correct 5x5 square.
Basically you construct a square like the following with the exact labellings:

  0 1 2 3 4
5 A B C D E
6 F G H I J
7 K L M N O
8 P Q R S T
9 U V W X Y

Then you simply pair up the numbers and you get the flag
