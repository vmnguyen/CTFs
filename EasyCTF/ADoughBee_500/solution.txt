Reverse the relevant function and we get something like
what's in reversed.txt.
Then, use a constraint solver to solve the problem (solver.py).

solve.py gives us:
[e = 2617829,
 d = 45064907,
 c = 58737215,
 a = 868615,
 b = 15961375]
e 1K3XH
d QTWAZ
c YYXXB
a IM87
b 9I3VJ


Put them in order, add leading 0's to make every group 5 characters:
0IM87 9I3VJ YYXXB QTWAZ 1K3XH
Then remove the spaces:
0IM879I3VJYYXXBQTWAZ1K3XH
