Going to http://web.easyctf.com:10201/index.source.php shows us
that there's a strcmp($_GET["password"], $pass) == 0 check.
Attempting to view stuff.php (the file being included) does not work,
so I googled "php strcmp bug".

The first link lead to http://danuxx.blogspot.com/2013/03/unauthorized-access-bypassing-php-strcmp.html
which tells us making password a non-string will make strcmp return 0,
which is what we want.

We make the query be http://web.easyctf.com:10201/index.php?password[]=a
to get the flag.
