The above command shows us a few lines of diff, but only some of it differs:
Sometimes by 1 sometimes by 0.

The difference, character by character, is:

011001010110000101110011011110010110001101110100011001100111101101111001011101010110111001101111011011110011000001101111011011110110111101101111011011110110111101101111011011110110111101101111011011110110111100110000011011110111110100000000
