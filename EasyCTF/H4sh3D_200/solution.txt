Reading the compute_hash() code, we can see that 4 characters
in the input correspond to 2 characters in the output.
This transformation is independent of the position in the input.
Using this, we can try every 4-letter combination of some characters
until we get a collision for each 2-letter sequence in the output.

solve.py contains the code.
