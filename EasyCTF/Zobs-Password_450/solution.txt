We receive some text in base64 and decode that to get
a bunch of e,N, and c's. All of these numbers are small, so
we look up the factors of N on factordb.com (we could use
a program like msieve for bigger numbers). With the factors,
we compute the totient of n: (p-1)*(q-1).
With the totient, it's simply a matter of:
    d = modinv(e, totient)
    pow(c, d, N)

Doing this for the first set gives us the flag.
Out of curiosity, I tried the 2nd one and it gave the same result.

flag{sH0r+_m3554g3}
