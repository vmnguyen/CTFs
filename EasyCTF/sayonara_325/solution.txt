Both the left and right channels are outputting different audio, and listening to the left channel
reveals audio of http://ask.fm/dragonhuman/answer/119833531098. However, this is a red herring, and what
we need to do is view the spectrogram of the right channel, which is the 'random' noise.

Looking at the spectrogram, we see some sort of text towards the bottom, which seems to be the flag.
If we speed up the audio with audacity, we can squash those characters together, making the flag more
readable.
