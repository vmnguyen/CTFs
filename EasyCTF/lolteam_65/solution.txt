To analyze the data with wireshark, we need to convert the pcapng file to pcap format. (I used http://pcapng.com/)

There's not much to search for, but if we follow the TCP stream of one of the packets, we find the following:
teamname=lolteam&school=lolschool&password=flag%7Bno%2C_lolteam_is_not_an_admin_account%7D&confirm=lolpasswordHTTP/1.1 200 OK

Urldecoded password:
flag{no,_lolteam_is_not_an_admin_account}
