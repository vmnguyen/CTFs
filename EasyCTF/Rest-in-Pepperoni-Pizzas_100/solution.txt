Hidden within the pdf is a picture, which you can extract by using an online tool or a simple hex
editor. The picture contains a bunch of fragmented pieces of the flag (throwback to HSF).
You could print out the image and do it manually, but all you really need to do is tilt your head around to
reconstruct the flag.
