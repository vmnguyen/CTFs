Note: This problem is basically a mirror of the CAMSCTF Murinae Mus problem. Thanks to Danny for the awesome scripts.

The file is actually tcpdump data, so if we open it up in wireshark, we can see that theres a lot
of USB data being passed around.
We can extract this data via:

    $ tshark -r ken_you_read_this -T fields -e usb.capdata > usb_data.txt

Then we can take all the instances for when the mouse was "clicked" which is when the the first set of bytes is 01 or 02.
Decoding this as binary where the left mouse click is 0 and the right mouse click is 1, we get the flag:

{it's_over_9000!!!}
